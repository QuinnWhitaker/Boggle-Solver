# Boggle-Solver
This program examines a boggle board, and searches a dictionary to find all words on the board

Boggle is a game that has a 4x4 board with a random assortment of letters. Players are tasked with finding words on the board, starting with any letter and creating words by adding adjacent letters until a legal word is made.

This program allows a user to either manually input a board, or create a random board. The program then searches the board and finds every possible word that can be created using it.
